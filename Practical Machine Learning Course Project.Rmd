<h3>Background</h3>

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

<h3>Load Libraries</h3>

```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
```

<h3>Load Data</h3>

The training data for this project are available here:

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
```
The test data are available here:

```{r}
testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
```

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

<h3>Partition Data</h3>

We have now a dataframe which contains all the workable features. So the first step is to split the dataset in two parts: the first for training and the second for testing.

```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]; myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```

<h3>Transform Data</h3>

The first transformation of the data for this project cleans, identifies possible NZV Variables, and creates a subset without NZV variables.

```{r}
myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)

myNZVvars <- names(myTraining) %in% c("new_window", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
                                      "kurtosis_yaw_belt", "skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
                                      "max_yaw_belt", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
                                      "var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
                                      "stddev_yaw_arm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
                                      "kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
                                      "max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
                                      "kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
                                      "skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
                                      "amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
                                      "skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
                                      "max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
                                      "amplitude_yaw_forearm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
                                      "avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
                                      "stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm")
myTraining <- myTraining[!myNZVvars]

dim(myTraining)
```

The second transformation of the data for this project removes the first ID variable so that it does not interfere with ML Algorithms.

```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
```

The third transformation of the data for this project cleans variables with too many NAs totaling 60% of total observations.

```{r}
trainingV3 <- myTraining #creating another subset to iterate in loop
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) { #for every column in the training dataset
    if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .6 ) { #if n?? NAs > 60% of total observations
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) ==1)  { #if the columns are the same:
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j] #Remove that column
            }   
        } 
    }
}

dim(trainingV3)

myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)
```

Repeat the transformations for test data.

```{r}
clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58]) #already with classe column removed
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]
testing <- testing[clean2]

dim(myTesting)
```

Coerce the data into the same type so that Decision Trees and RandomForest Algorithm work properly with test data.

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
    for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) ==1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}

testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing) #note row 2 does not mean anything, this will be removed right.. now:
testing <- testing[-1,]
```

<h3>ML Algorithm: Decision Tree</h3>

Assign variable and view Decision Tree.

```{r}
modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)
```

Predict and test results with Confusion Matrix and Statistics.

```{r}
predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, myTesting$classe)
```

<h3>ML Algorithm: RandomForest</h3>

Assign variable, predict in-sample error, and view Confusion Matrix and Statistics showing 0.9986 accuracy in our model.

```{r}
modFitB1 <- randomForest(classe ~. , data=myTraining)
predictionsB1 <- predict(modFitB1, myTesting, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(predictionsB1, myTesting$classe)
```

<h3>Submit Data</h3>

Assign variable, use test out-of-sample error, and use RandomForest Algorithm.

```{r}
predictionsB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")

pml_write_files = function(x){
    n = length(x)
    for(i in 1:n){
        filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
        write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
    }
}

pml_write_files(predictionsB2)
```
